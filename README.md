SpaceOut! Bounce Them Bullets!

Pitch:
Have you ever wanted to play a SHMUP, but in your heart of hearts, you're a die-hard Breakout fan? Well, look no further! SpaceOut looks and plays much like a traditional SHMUP, with the glaring exception that you're not allowed to shoot. Instead, your retro spinning ship is equipped with a state-of-the-art Space Mirror! This mirror has the incredible power to completely deflect any incoming projectiles. Unfortunately, you were only able to afford the budget-friendly "Baby's First Space Mirror," which isn't quite big enough to cover your while ship. I guess you'll just have to spin that baby around!

Technical Description:
SpaceOut remixes the traditional SHMUP playstyle by removing the ability to shoot enemies. Players must rotate a shield around their ship, and using it to deflect bullets as they approach. Deflecting these bullets into enemies will score points for the player, compromising the main goal of the game- beat the high score!

Aesthetics Description:
SpaceOut is intended to have a visual aesthetic reminiscent to the brick-breaking classic Breakout, which was very minimal and geometric in nature. SpaceOut also incorporates some SHMUP visual tropes, including the space theme, stars, and glowing neon trails all over the place.

Design Goals:
The primary goal of SpaceOut was to experiment with how integral the ability to shoot is with the SHMUP genre. Having no form of retaliation, however, doesn't make for a fun gameplay experience, so styling the game to be "defensive" instead of "offensive" felt like the best approach. Early in the development of the game, Breakout became a major inspiration for the game's core gameplay loop, and so creating highly responsive controls & strong visual cues quickly became major design goals as well.
